### 5. **Use C++ to Build a Crypto Trading Platform: Final System**
   - **Description**:  
     Bring together everything youâ€™ve learned in the specialization to design and implement a fully functional cryptocurrency trading platform.
   - **What You'll Learn**:
     - Integrate classes, functions, and data structures into a cohesive project.
     - Handle user input, manage transactions, and simulate market data.
     - Optimize your code for performance and maintainability.
   - **Skills**:
     - Project integration
     - Performance optimization
     - Full-stack development (C++)

## Project: Cryptocurrency Trading Platform

This specialization revolves around designing a simplified cryptocurrency trading platform. By the end of the program, you will have built a fully functional system capable of:
- Handling user input via an interactive menu.
- Managing bids, asks, and transactions.
- Displaying market statistics and simulating a trading environment.

### Course Structure (Yet to be done)
This repository is organized into directories for each course:
- `Course_1_Introduction`: Beginner-level concepts, menu systems, and initial trading platform code.
- `Course_2_Classes_and_Data`: Class design, data encapsulation, and memory management.
- `Course_3_Functions`: Advanced function implementations like templates and operator overloading.
- `Course_4_Objects`: Inheritance, polymorphism, and modular programming examples.
- `Course_5_Final_Project`: The complete cryptocurrency trading platform code.

---

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this specialization, you will:
1. Understand the core principles of C++ programming and object-oriented design.
2. Be proficient in writing modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
3. Gain experience with data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.
4. Develop a portfolio-worthy capstone project.
